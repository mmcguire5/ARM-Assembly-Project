--This was a project that I worked on with one other partner during my first semester of assembly language in undergrad
--The project is written in ARM assembly language using Keil Microvision
--The project created a game in which an asterisk starts in the middle of a board. The game begins when the user inputs 'i,' 'j,' 'k,' or 'm,' representing up, left, right, down respectively
--The user must keep the asterisk from hitting a wall
--The user gets one point for every space he/she moves
--Every 10 points, the game doubles in speed
--The game ends when the asterisk hits a wall
--For this project, we implemented much of what we learned throughout the semester including timers, character output/input, interrupts, baud rate, algorithms, etc...
